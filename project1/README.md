# Class Project 1

Explain how we did small technical details and how users can re-use our code
State full instructions on how to run our code, how to reproduce obtained results, give overview of architecture of our code (what are the different files, what they contain)


### Installation



### Architecture

#### FILES

##### config.py

##### data_loader.py

##### implementations.py
This file contains all our optimization algorithms for the regression tasks, i.e. linear regression using (stochastic) gradient descent, closed form least squares and ridge regression and (regularized logistic regression. All functions return their computed optimal weights and the final loss.

##### preprocessing.py
We gathered all our preprocessing functions in this file, 

##### helpers.py

##### project1.ipynb

##### run.py

##### utils.py

##### visualization.py


### Usage

To run our project, simply execute run.py in your terminal.
