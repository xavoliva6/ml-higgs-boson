TODOS:

1. Class Imbalance (SMOTE is suuuper slow, ... maybe use PCA instead?)
2. When using Polynomial Feature Augmentation, LS-SGD and LS procude huge errors...
  - in some occurences, it even influence ridge regression and makes it waaay worse
3. Add Accuracy next to validation loss [DONE]
4. Someone Needs to go over what i did, so i didnt do any error
5. Some confilct with groups + k-fold (e.g. "best method" info is a bit weird now): not sure if there is really any problem
6. test out preprocessing method and see if they work & have a positive influence
7. test out different params (i.e. max param, regression paramete, ...)
8. Maybe use acc instead of loss to select model???
9. Do batch sgd
10. finish doctstring for files and function and add comments
11. add download [download]
12. use multiprocessing package to prallelize distance matrix
